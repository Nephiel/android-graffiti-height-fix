Graffiti Height Fix
===================

The classic handwriting recognition software from Palm, known as Graffiti™, is still available as a text input method for Android on the Play Store.
Sadly, the publisher, Access Co., LTD., seems to have abandoned development and hasn't released any updates since 2011.

As a result, on modern Android devices with high resolution screens, the input area was too small to be useful... *until now*.

**Graffiti Height Fix** is an **Xposed Framework module** that **makes the Graffiti™ input area taller** on high resolution screens.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Rooted Android device
- [Xposed Framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/xposed-installer-versions-changelog-t2714053)
- [Graffiti™ 2.0.6](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.access_company.graffiti) or [Graffiti™ Pro 1.0.2](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.access_company.graffiti_pro) by ACCESS CO., LTD.

I am not affiliated with nor sponsored by ACCESS CO., LTD., I'm just a long time user of Graffiti since the old Palm days, who still finds it doing a much better job than any other text input method for handheld devices.

Also on the [Google Play Store](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nephiel.graffitiheightfix).
